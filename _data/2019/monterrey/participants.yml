Since memory and present are inextricably bound to futurity, he follows concepts as a way to see how this horizon ties to national visions and imaginaries. He has worked and lived in three different Latin-American countries, so he is keen on using computational social methods to better understand the region, its history, and the way it stands towards the Grand Challenges of our time."
