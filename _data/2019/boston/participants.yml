- name: Frances Chen
  image: /2019/boston/images/fchen.jpg
  bio: "Dr. Frances Chen is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at Georgia State University. Her research is focused on biosocial bases of antisocial behavior and related constructs, and includes topics at the intersection of criminology and psychology. Her quantitative works examine how life events and turning points in life (e.g., marriage) shape antisocial behavior, and how environment interacts with individuals’ biological characteristics (e.g., stress system, fear conditioning) to exacerbate or limit antisocial behavior throughout the life-course. She employs both psychophysiological recording and salivary bioscience research methods in furtherance of this work. Her current research on psychobiological and social characteristics of active, noninstitutionalized hardcore street offenders is an endeavor to advance our knowledge of the persistence in offending."

  bio: "Muyang Li is a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at University at Albany, SUNY. She holds a BA in Communication from the Communication University of China and an MSc in New Media from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Her research is organized around a key question: how does media interact with democracy and social justice. Her research is interdisciplinary in scope, which relies on methodological and theoretical frameworks across disciplines and fields, including sociology, communication, cultural studies, political science, and computer/information technology. Given these interests and her interdisciplinary background, Muyang’s dissertation applies mixed-method in exploring the negotiation between the authoritarian state and the individual in defining democracy through the social media, and try to reveal how the authoritarian regimes survived the ideological crisis in the social media era through the combination of repressive and hegemonic media control strategies."
