      bio: Ridhi Kashyap is associate professor of social demography and fellow of Nuffield College at the University of Oxford. She completed her DPhil in Sociology jointly affiliated with the University of Oxford and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. Her research spans a number of substantive areas in demography and sociology, including gender, mortality and health, the diversification of family forms, and ethnicity and migration. Her work has sought to adopt computational innovations both in terms of modelling approaches such as agent-based models and digital trace data from web and social media platforms to study social and demographic processes.  She is currently leading a Data2X and UN Foundation supported project that uses big data from the web, in particular large-scale online advertising data that provide information on the aggregate numbers of users of online platforms by demographic characteristics, to measure sustainable development and gender inequality indicators.

    - name: Arran Davis
      bio: Arran recently finished his DPhil (PhD) at the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology, University of Oxford, where he was a Clarendon Scholar. He is now teaching quantitative methods at both the undergraduate and graduate level at Oxford, as well as working part time as a data scientist at TextureAI. Using evolutionary theory to understand human behaviour, he has studied the cultural activities that lead to bonded, cooperative relationships among humans. Arran's DPhil focused on the effects of social relationships on human health and wellbeing. Specifically, he used experimental, observational, and 'big data' approaches to understand how social support and cohesion can enhance the performance of physical exercise through reducing perceptions of pain and fatigue. Particularly relevant to the SICSS, he built social networks using data from over 10 million runs at parkrun (a free, weekly, community based 5 km run that happens at over 600 locations around the world) to demonstrate how the presence of close social relationships can improve run times and exercise adherence. Arran is excited to advance his (largely self taught) knowledge of the network sciences, web scrapping, Python, and R, especially with regard to how these methods and tools can be successfully applied to answering the challenges we face as a society.
