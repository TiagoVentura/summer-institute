# Live Stream

For those unable to attend the Summer Institute in person, we will be live-streaming all lectures. [Click here to access the live stream.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRV9I1xz2KwlgvLQ8OadKw) No registration is required to watch the live stream. 

For the best experience, we encourage that you follow the slides posted in the ["Schedule & materials" section of the Summer Institute website](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2019/#schedule).
